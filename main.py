# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print("Abdullah")
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator /
num12 = 5
num13 = 5
results0 = num12 / num13
print(results0)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
num1 = 4
num2 = 4
results = num1 + num2
print(results)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
Length = 3 
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 6
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = Length * width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(area)

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
